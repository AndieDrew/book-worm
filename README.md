## Project Reflection and Individual Learning Goals
##### Sarah

##### Jon
Learning Goals: Learning TypeScript and successfully building a React application using it was by far my biggest goal. Secondarily, I'd hoped to gain a better understanding of how I learn when looking into a new technology without the structure of guided lectures. 

Challenges: Although TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with an extra bit of syntax, implementing it correctly can be a tedious task. When following a strict TypeScript configuration, errors are consistent and their messages can be difficult to understand when seeing them for the first time. 

Wins: Getting through the challenges of TypeScript and building an application that uses it efficiently and accurately (with no shortcuts) is a huge accomplishment. Also, understanding the benefits of TypeScript and having the capacity to explain why a dev team would use it.

## Future Iterations
After reaching the minimum viable product we established for this project, we attempted to extend the capabilities of BookWorm by adding a feature for displaying additional details for a given book. A 'Details' button was added to each book and once clicked a separate page with more information about the associated book would render. Although we made a lot of progress on this feature, we feel that what we currently have is not complete enough for production - the work we did can be found on this [branch](https://github.com/jon-schlandt/book-worm/tree/feature/details). 

We hope to continue work on this feature and possibly add more features, like a search bar for category filtering, to provide a more enjoyable and efficient user experience.
